        Hello. You probably noticed that my name is rather unusual. My father came from North eastern Turkey (the mountains in the photo), near a small town called Artvin, close to the Georgian border. My mother was from an ancient derbyshire family - the Hallams. I have 2 wonderful grown up children, 2 very sweet grand-children and 2 lovely step-children with my adorable wife (on the photo). I've spent what seems like a lifetime indulging my passion for music. In my career as a concert pianist I have regularly performed all of the Rachmaninov concertos. I also have a Maths degree from UCL and spent almost 40 years in full time teaching, including 15 years as a Headmaster.</p>

      <p>Here in my Image Gallery you can see a selection of photos. The moorland is The peak District of Derbyshire; the flowers are from my garden. Others are from a recent trip my wife and I took to Rome. This was a fabulous cultural experience, taking in all the major artworks from the Sistine Chapel to the Borghese Gallery. Not to mention my favourite all time sculpture - Michaelangelo's Pieta with marble so smooth it just seems to drip.</p>
